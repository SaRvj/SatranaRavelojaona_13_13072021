# ArgentBank

is a fresh new bank trying to break into the industry and wants to implement her APP In that way, two phases have been set up :

-   Phase 1: User authentication

The goal here was to transform a static HTML and CSS mock-up into a React responsive application. For this purpose, it was requested to use react as a state manager and respect several issues to achieve this.

-   Phase 2: transactions We are here in a conception phase of a new feature that can allow users to view all their transactions for the current month, the details of a transaction in another view and to add, modify or delete information about a transaction.

It's a question here of documenting the implementation of these functionalities on the API side by using the Swagger syntax.
